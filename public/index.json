Examples are the Asian Financial Crisis, Dot.com bubble, Global Financial Crisis, Sovereign Debt Crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic. The European Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR) requires financial institutions that adopt the Advanced Internal Ratings Based Approach (A-IRB) models to use Loss Given Default (LGD) estimates that are appropriate for an economic downturn if those are more conservative than the long-run average LGD. A similar requirement is imposed by the regulation for Credit Conversion Factors.\nThis deep-dive course provides context of regulatory requirements for identifying economic downturn periods and of those for estimating the downturn LGD and CCF risk parameters. Key challenges met by model developers when applying the regulatory requirements concerning economic downturn are treated in detail, for example\n When are economic indicators deemed relevant for identifying an economic downturn? How should one determine what is considered to be an economic downturn period? Which of the approaches identified in regulation should be followed for quantifying Downturn LGDs? How can the volatility of capital requirements be limited if LGD estimates are sensitive to economic conditions? How should the downturn LGD for in-default exposures be modelled and what is the relation to the EL$_{\\text{BE}}$? What are the main drivers of model risk for Downturn LGD and CCF estimates, and which Margin of Conservatism items should be considered for Downturn quantification purposes?  The exact course contents are adapted based on a survey under participants 4-6 weeks before start of the course.\nLearning Goals After completing the course, the participants will be able to identify downturn periods by gaining knowledge on the following topics:\n Selection of relevant economic indicators Considerations with regard to geography and sectors Choice of historical period, frequency of the data and implications Guidance for transformations of economic indicators Co-movement of economic indicators Identification of adjacent peaks and troughs Pitfalls in the downturn period identification  Furthermore, participants will be able to quantify Downturn LGD by gaining knowledge on the following topics:\n  Three main Downturn quantification approaches:\n Type 1 - Observed impact approach Type 2 - Extrapolation/haircut approach Type 3 - Flexible approach with minimum add-ons    Treatment of incomplete recovery cases in Downturn estimates\n  Accounting for LGD estimates that are unduly sensitive to the economic cycle\n  Backtesting Downturn estimates\n  Regulatory challenger model\n  Choosing a final relevant Downturn period\n  When to use Downturn LGD estimates in the calculation of capital requirements\n  Pitfalls in the downturn LGD quantification\n  Participants will also gain knowledge of the following topics:\n Margin of Conservatism for Downturn Quantification of Downturn CCF Key process steps in Downturn quantification Focus points during Model Validation Relation between Downturn requirements and related requirements for LGD and PD.  Target Audience The course is intended for:\n IRB model developers and team leads with a specific interest in economic downturn IRB modelling. Model validators and team leads with similar interests. Supervisors and policy advisors wishing to gain insight in the challenges of applying regulation with regard to economic downturn.

The European Capital Requirements Regulation prescribes that institutions should add to its risk parameters estimates a Margin of Conservatism (MoC) which reflects uncertainties in the estimated risk parameters. These uncertainties should be calculated based on a comprehensive process to identify and quantify deficiencies in risk parameter estimation. Biases should be addressed by so-called appropriate adjustments and the MoC should also reflect the uncertainties on these adjustments.\nWhile perhaps conceptually straightforward, the implementation of these regulatory requirements and guidelines is seen as one of the more challenging aspects of implementing IRB. Firstly, because of the complex nature of the requirements and underlying concepts, and secondly, because of the practical difficulties in connecting the theoretical basis and regulation to the practical reality of risk model development and validation.\nThis advanced course brings to model developers and model validators a thorough understanding of the statistical and conceptual basis of Margin of Conservatism and the applicable regulation, as well as the mental machinery to help bring these into practice. Through challenging hands-on case studies, interactive lectures and stimulating discourse, participants will gain experience with, among others, the following topics\n Integration of a conceptual and statistical basis of the Margin of Conservatism with regulatory terminology and supervisory expectations Setup, verification and challenge of a process for the identication, quantification and validation of model deficiencies and uncertainties Expected key elements of a Margin of Conservatism framework Approaches for deriving appropriate adjustments and MoC factors for typical sources of bias and uncertainty, such as  a lack of data quality, completeness or representativeness limitations to the method of quantification of risk parameters changes to default- and loss definitions, underwriting standards, collection and recovery policies, or business environments   Understanding the general estimation error Aggregation of the Margin of Conservatism to the risk parameter level, including Downturn LGD Requirements for the use of human judgment  The exact course contents are adapted based on a survey under participants 4-6 weeks before start of the course.\nLearning Goals After completing the course, the participants will be able to\n Quantify the Margin of Conservatism for typical sources of bias and uncertainty in credit risk modelling Challenge and verify the completeness, correctness and compliance of a MoC derivation Set up a process and recognize key decisions for the identification of deficiencies and uncertainties in the data and methodology Understand trade-offs between different approaches in terms of complexity, explainability, and conservatism  Target Audience The course is intended for:\n IRB model developers and team leads with a specific interest in determining appropriate adjustments and a Margin of Conservatism for the PD, LGD and EAD/CCF risk parameters. Model validators, Auditors and team leads with similar interests. Supervisors and policy advisors wishing to gain insight in the challenges of regulation with regard to the Margin of Conservatism. Model Owners and Credit Risk Controllers wishing to enhance their understanding of the Margin of Conservatism  Prerequisites Participants are advised to come equipped with a basic understanding of:\n the calculation of minimum capital requirements modelling the PD, LGD and EAD/CCF risk parameters.  Format The material will be taught through active learning and spaced repetition with a focus on acquiring problem-solving strategies for relevant and realistic case studies.\nActive learning Extensive research 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 has shown that active, problem-driven learning strategies stimulate active engagement and are more effective than passive strategies. At eduquant, course participants actively participate in solving problems and working out mini-projects right from the start, after the first 10 minutes of introduction. Background material and theory is presented only afterwards, as part of the discussion and treatment of the solutions and outcomes of the problems. This ensures that students have an active interest in, and an immediate context for, the theoretical material being presented.\nSpaced repetition Another core element of the eduquant teaching strategy is the use of spaced sessions with retrieval practice, which has been shown 7, 8 to consistently benefit long-term retention. The material is treated over the course of several sessions, rather than in a consecutive full-day schedule. After the first session, participants will be challenged to retrieve material treated in earlier sessions.\nRealistic case studies At eduquant we believe specialist professionals are best helped by acquiring problem solving strategies for problems they are likely to encounter in their professional practice, rather than theoretical knowledge. Based on our extensive experience as risk modellers, consultants, supervisors and researchers, we develop case studies that are highly relevant, close to the type of problems participants are likely to encounter in their profession, at any level of mastery. The outcome of the cases studies are discussed in a plenary session with additional context and theoretical background.

Contact us to discuss options. For larger groups (7 or more), we recommend to have the option to break out in separate groups of up to 4 participants. Offline sessions will be webcast, the main presentations recorded and shared for a limited time with participants for later review.\nOnline For online participation we leverage the ikuvikyuⓇ platform which offers, besides the usual features for webconferencing, the options to\n opening breakout sessions for participants (for collaborative case studies) multiway sharing and presenting (for sharing and presenting case study results) interactive polling and surveys (for focused problem sets)  These features allow the trainers to engage with participants collectively as well as in smaller groups or individually. The main presentations will be recorded and shared for a limited time with participants for later review.\nDate and duration The course is comprised of three morning or afternoon sessions of 4 hours each, once per week.
