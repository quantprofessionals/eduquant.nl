## Courses

Courses are priced per participant and per course, with a baseline fee per course and cumulative discounts applied over additional participants and additional courses.

#### Discounts

We greatly value our repeating and long-term customers and reflect our appreciation for your longer term and larger scale trust in our services through various kinds of cumulative discounts. Nice!

##### Book multiple courses in advance

 * Each additional course booked beyond the first gets you an additional 5% discount on the total of baseline fees. 
 * For example, when booking 5 courses in advance, a total discount of 25% will be applied on the baseline fee.

##### Book multiple participants

 * Each additional participant of a class on an application beyond the first has a additional 2.5% discount on their per-participant charge, to a maximum of 15 participants for a full class.
 * For example, when booking a full class of 15 participants, a discount of 17.5% on the total per-participant charge applies.

##### Other

 * First-time clients qualify for additional discounts
 * Extensive bespoke options may incur additional costs based on marginal effort, but in case of bulk purchases these may be waived.
