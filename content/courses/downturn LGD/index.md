## Content

History has witnessed severe economic crises with an impact on financial institutions worldwide. Examples are the Asian Financial Crisis, Dot.com bubble, Global Financial Crisis, Sovereign Debt Crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic. The European Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR) requires financial institutions that adopt the Advanced Internal Ratings Based Approach (A-IRB) models to use Loss Given Default (LGD) estimates that are appropriate for an economic downturn if those are more conservative than the long-run average LGD. A similar requirement is imposed by the regulation for Credit Conversion Factors. 

This deep-dive course provides context of regulatory requirements for identifying economic downturn periods and of those for estimating the downturn LGD and CCF risk parameters. Key challenges met by model developers when applying the regulatory requirements concerning economic downturn are treated in detail, for example

* When are economic indicators deemed relevant for identifying an economic downturn?
* How should one determine what is considered to be an economic downturn period?
* Which of the approaches identified in regulation should be followed for quantifying Downturn LGDs?
* How can the volatility of capital requirements be limited if LGD estimates are sensitive to economic conditions?
* How should the downturn LGD for in-default exposures be modelled and what is the relation to the EL$_{\text{BE}}$?
* What are the main drivers of model risk for Downturn LGD and CCF estimates, and which Margin of Conservatism items should be considered for Downturn quantification purposes?

The exact course contents are adapted based on a survey under participants 4-6 weeks before start of the course.

## Learning Goals

After completing the course, the participants will be able to identify downturn periods by gaining knowledge on the following topics:

* Selection of relevant economic indicators
* Considerations with regard to geography and sectors
* Choice of historical period, frequency of the data and implications
* Guidance for transformations of economic indicators 
* Co-movement of economic indicators
* Identification of adjacent peaks and troughs
* Pitfalls in the downturn period identification

Furthermore, participants will be able to quantify Downturn LGD by gaining knowledge on the following topics:

* Three main Downturn quantification approaches:

  * Type 1 - Observed impact approach
  * Type 2 - Extrapolation/haircut approach
  * Type 3 - Flexible approach with minimum add-ons
* Treatment of incomplete recovery cases in Downturn estimates
* Accounting for LGD estimates that are unduly sensitive to the economic cycle
* Backtesting Downturn estimates
* Regulatory challenger model
* Choosing a final relevant Downturn period
* When to use Downturn LGD estimates in the calculation of capital requirements
* Pitfalls in the downturn LGD quantification

Participants will also gain knowledge of the following topics:

* Margin of Conservatism for Downturn
* Quantification of Downturn CCF
* Key process steps in Downturn quantification
* Focus points during Model Validation
* Relation between Downturn requirements and related requirements for LGD and PD.  

## Target Audience

The course is intended for:

* IRB model developers and team leads with a specific interest in economic downturn IRB modelling.
* Model validators and team leads with similar interests.
* Supervisors and policy advisors wishing to gain insight in the challenges of applying regulation with regard to economic downturn.
* Credit risk managers wishing to enhance their understanding of Downturn LGD modelling

### Prerequisites

Participants are advised to come equipped with aasic understanding of: 

* the calculation of capital requirements
* relevant regulation for A-IRB
* modelling the LGD and EAD/CCF risk parameters.


## Format

The material will be taught through active learning and spaced repetition with a focus on acquiring problem-solving strategies for relevant and realistic case studies.


### Active learning

Extensive research [^1]<sup>, </sup>[^2]<sup>, </sup>[^3]<sup>, </sup>[^4]<sup>, </sup>[^5]<sup>, </sup>[^6] has shown that active, problem-driven learning strategies stimulate active engagement and are more effective than passive strategies. At eduquant, course participants actively participate in solving problems and working out mini-projects right from the start, after the first 10 minutes of introduction. Background material and theory is presented only afterwards, as part of the discussion and treatment of the solutions and outcomes of the problems. This ensures that students have an active interest in, and an immediate context for, the theoretical material being presented.  

### Spaced repetition

Another core element of the eduquant teaching strategy is the use of spaced sessions with retrieval practice, which has been shown [^7]<sup>, </sup>[^8] to consistently benefit long-term retention. The material is treated over the course of several sessions, rather than in a consecutive full-day schedule. After the first session, participants will be challenged to retrieve material treated in earlier sessions. 


### Case studies

At eduquant we believe specialist professionals are best helped by acquiring problem solving strategies for problems they are likely to encounter in their professional practice, rather than theoretical knowledge. Based on [our extensive experience]({{< ref "/#about" >}} "About us") as risk modellers, consultants, supervisors and researchers, we develop case studies that are highly relevant, realistic and close to the type of problems participants are likely to encounter in their profession, at any level of mastery. The outcome of the cases studies are discussed in a plenary session with additional context and theoretical background.

#### Example case studies

For this course, examples of case studies are 

 * Present arguments whether or not a proposed treatment of identifying a downturn period is compliant with regulation
 * Give a comprehensive list of potential deficiencies of a downturn LGD derivation based on shared documentation
 * Identify the major policy decisions underlying a compliant downturn EAD estimation
 * Define an approach for identyfing an economic downturn and estimating downturn LGD values given documentation and data on portfolio characteristics, economic series and the opportunity of a Q&A session with a business representative 

### Online and offline

This course can be organised in an offline, an online, or a combined on- and offline version. 

#### Offline

Offline sessions can be offered on-premise as well as organized off site (priced at cost) - [contact us]({{< ref "/#contact" >}} "Contact Us") to discuss options. For all but the smallest groups (7 or more), we recommend to have the option to break out in separate groups of up to 4 participants. Offline sessions will be webcast, the main presentations recorded and shared for a limited time with participants for later review.

#### Online

For online participation we leverage the [ikuvikyu](https://ikyvikyo.org)<sub><sup>Ⓡ</sup></sub>  platform which offers, besides the usual features for webconferencing, the options to 

 * opening breakout sessions for participants (for collaborative case studies)
 * multiway sharing and presenting (for sharing and presenting case study results)
 * interactive polling and surveys (for focused problem sets)
 
These features allow the trainers to engage with participants collectively as well as in smaller groups, or individually, for case studies. The main presentations will be recorded and shared for a limited time with participants for later review.


## Date and duration
