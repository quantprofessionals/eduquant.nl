## Content

The definition of default (DoD) is a fulcrum of the Basel framework for credit risk and the Capital Requirements Regulation. Differences in application, regulation and regulatory practice of default criteria were pointed to as major sources of RWA variability during the redesign of the Basel framework. Following the financial crisis, the European Banking Authority (EBA) has established tighter standards around the definition of default (CRR Article 178) to achieve greater alignment across banks and jurisdictions. The two-phase introduction of the new regulation for banks supervised by the ECB has lead to major changes in risk classification at banks and of the management of distressed assets. 

Banks that have carried out a quantitative impact analysis have found that the new DoD can materially impact the number, timing, duration and even outcome of defaults. Where the impact is material, risk management and valuation processes need to be updated, including accounting (IFRS9) and capital requirement modeling (IRB and ICAAP).

This deep-dive course provides context of changes to regulatory requirements for the definition of default, the challenges during the implementation of the definition of default, for example:

 * Determining the number of days past due for default identification
 * Indications of unlikeness to pay
 * Conditions for return to non-defaulted status
 * the application of the DoD in external data
 * the update of the internal policies and risk management processes

Moreover, this course will cover the topics of 

 * evidencing the correct implementation of the DoD
 * monitoring the effectiveness of the new policy
 * recalibration of the IRB risk parameters by applying appropriate adjustment of historical data and appropriate quantification of MoC.

## Learning Goals
<!-- learning goals should describe problem solving strategies -->
In this course you will gain knowledge of the following topics:

 * the classification of exposures to defaulted and performing
 * the context and impact of recent developments of regulation regarding the definition of default and non-performing exposures
 * details of the requirements regarding the new definition of default in the new regulation
 * an overview of the changes to policies, systems, models and processes triggered by the change in regulation 
 * main challenges banks face in implementing these changes and their impact
 * typical data modelling and data quality issues concerning DoD changes faced by banks
 * approaches for calculating appropriate adjustments of historical data in order to reflect the new DoD
 * main drivers of uncertainty related to DoD changes and the associated margin of conservatism

## Target Audience

The course is intended for

 * IRB model developers and validators
 * Auditors 
 * Specialist supervisors and JST members
 * Credit risk managers

### Prerequisites

Participants are advised to come equipped with a broad understanding of credit risk, Basel and capital requirements regulation.

## Schedule

The course will be taught over 4 sessions of each 4 hours, with at most 2 sessions per week. The final session schedule will be planned in coordination with participants 6 weeks prior, and confirmed at the latest 4 weeks prior to the start of the course.

## Format

The material will be taught through active learning and spaced repetition with a focus on acquiring problem-solving strategies for relevant and realistic case studies.


### Active learning

Extensive research [^1]<sup>, </sup>[^2]<sup>, </sup>[^3]<sup>, </sup>[^4]<sup>, </sup>[^5]<sup>, </sup>[^6] has shown that active, problem-driven learning strategies stimulate active engagement and are more effective than passive strategies. At eduquant, course participants actively participate in solving problems and working out mini-projects right from the start, after the first 10 minutes of introduction. Background material and theory is presented only afterwards, as part of the discussion and treatment of the solutions and outcomes of the problems. This ensures that students have an active interest in, and an immediate context for, the theoretical material being presented.  

### Spaced repetition

Another core element of the eduquant teaching strategy is the use of spaced sessions with retrieval practice, which has been shown [^7]<sup>, </sup>[^8] to consistently benefit long-term retention. The material is treated over the course of several sessions, rather than in a consecutive full-day schedule. After the first session, participants will be challenged to retrieve material treated in earlier sessions. 


### Case studies

At eduquant we believe specialist professionals are best helped by acquiring problem solving strategies for problems they are likely to encounter in their professional practice, rather than theoretical knowledge. Based on [our extensive experience]({{< ref "/#about" >}} "About us") as risk modellers, consultants, supervisors and researchers, we develop case studies that are highly relevant, realistic and close to the type of problems participants are likely to encounter in their profession, at any level of mastery. The outcome of the cases studies are discussed in a plenary session with additional context and theoretical background.

#### Example case studies

For this course, examples of case studies are 

 * Present arguments whether or not a proposed treatment of PD calibration for low-default portfolios is compliant with regulation
 * Give a comprehensive list of potential deficiencies of a downturn LGD derivation based on shared documentation
 * Identify the major policy decisions underlying a compliant EAD estimation for a low-default specialized lending portfolio
 * Compare and understand the impact of different treatments of LGD estimation based on prepared code samples and realistic data sets

### Online and offline

This course can be organised in an offline, an online, or a combined on- and offline version. 

#### Offline

Offline sessions can be offered on-premise as well as organized off site (priced at cost) - [contact us]({{< ref "/#contact" >}} "Contact Us") to discuss options. For all but the smallest groups (7 or more), we recommend to have the option to break out in separate groups of up to 4 participants. Offline sessions will be webcast, the main presentations recorded and shared for a limited time with participants for later review.

#### Online

For online participation we leverage the [ikuvikyu](https://ikyvikyo.org)<sub><sup>Ⓡ</sup></sub>  platform which offers, besides the usual features for webconferencing, the options to 

 * opening breakout sessions for participants (for collaborative case studies)
 * multiway sharing and presenting (for sharing and presenting case study results)
 * interactive polling and surveys (for focused problem sets)
 
These features allow the trainers to engage with participants collectively as well as in smaller groups, or individually, for case studies. The main presentations will be recorded and shared for a limited time with participants for later review.


## Date and duration

The course is comprised of three morning or afternoon sessions of 4 hrs each, once per week. Please [Contact us]({{< ref "/#contact" >}} "Contact Us") for details and options for the schedule.


## Pricing

Pricing is based on the level and duration of the course, and the number of participants per application. [See here]({{< ref "/pricing" >}} "Pricing") for additional information.
