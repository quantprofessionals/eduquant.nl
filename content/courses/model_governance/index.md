## Content

Banks that decide and get approval to use internal models need to invest in developing and maintaining high quality models. They need to have sound internal validation and oversight processes in place. Collectively, these are known as the Model Risk Governance framework of the bank.

We will explain the three lines of defense model as applied to model risk, the role of model validation and audit, the review of estimates and the broader model life cycle. 

Participants will be challenged to understand and deal with common impediments to effective model risk management. The supervisory view on Model Governance will be discussed as well.
