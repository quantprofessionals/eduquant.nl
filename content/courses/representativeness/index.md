## Content

The concept of data representativeness, analysis of representativeness and mitigation of the effect of non-representativeness are emphasized in the [Guidelines on PD & LGD estimation](https://www.eba.europa.eu/regulation-and-policy/model-validation/guidelines-on-pd-lgd-estimation-and-treatment-of-defaulted-assets). While conceptually straightforward, determining, the required assessments, interpreting their results, mitigating the effects and assessing the validity of a treatment often pose a challenge to model developers and model validators.

Additional complexities arise in case of the estimation of LGD parameters, rating systems covering [low-default portfolios]({{< ref "/courses/low_default_portfolios" >}}), acquisitions or divestment, changes to [definition of default]({{< ref "/courses/dod" >}})

## Learning Goals



## Target Audience

The course module is intended for:

 * IRB model developers
 * Model validators, Auditors and team leads with similar interests.
 * Supervisors and policy advisors wishing to gain insight in the challenges of regulation with regard to representativeness.
 * Model users, model risk management officers and Credit Risk Controllers wishing to enhance their understanding of representativeness


### Prerequisites
The material will be taught in English. 
Participants are advised to come equipped with a basic understanding of: 

 * the calculation of minimum capital requirements
 * modelling the PD, LGD and EAD/CCF risk parameters.

## Schedule

The module will be taught over{{< param nr_sessions >}} sessions of each {{< param session >}}. The track schedule will be planned in coordination with the client based on the selection of modules.

## Format

The material will be taught through active learning and spaced repetition with a focus on acquiring problem-solving strategies for relevant and realistic case studies.


### Active learning

Extensive research [^1]<sup>, </sup>[^2]<sup>, </sup>[^3]<sup>, </sup>[^4]<sup>, </sup>[^5]<sup>, </sup>[^6] has shown that active, problem-driven learning strategies stimulate active engagement and are more effective than passive strategies. At eduquant, course participants actively participate in solving problems and working out mini-projects right from the start, after the first 10 minutes of introduction. Background material and theory is presented only afterwards, as part of the discussion and treatment of the solutions and outcomes of the problems. This ensures that students have an active interest in, and an immediate context for, the theoretical material being presented.  

### Spaced repetition

Another core element of the eduquant teaching strategy is the use of spaced sessions with retrieval practice, which has been shown [^7]<sup>, </sup>[^8] to consistently benefit long-term retention. The material is treated over the course of several sessions, rather than in a consecutive full-day schedule. After the first session, participants will be challenged to retrieve material treated in earlier sessions. 


### Case studies

At eduquant we believe specialist professionals are best helped by acquiring problem solving strategies for problems they are likely to encounter in their professional practice, rather than theoretical knowledge. Based on [our extensive experience]({{< ref "/#about" >}} "About us") as risk modellers, consultants, supervisors and researchers, we develop case studies that are highly relevant, realistic and close to the type of problems participants are likely to encounter in their profession, at any level of mastery. The outcome of the cases studies are discussed in a plenary session with additional context and theoretical background.

#### Example case studies

For this module, examples of case studies are 

 * Identify major potential sources of uncertainty, given documentation of a PD estimation methodology
 * Compare the strengths and weaknesses of alternative MoC estimation approaches related to representativeness
 * Explain the relation between model risk and MoC to front office risk management
