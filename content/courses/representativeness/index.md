## Content

The concept of data representativeness, analysis of representativeness and mitigation of the effect of non-representativeness are emphasized in the [Guidelines on PD & LGD estimation](https://www.eba.europa.eu/regulation-and-policy/model-validation/guidelines-on-pd-lgd-estimation-and-treatment-of-defaulted-assets). While conceptually straightforward, determining, the required assessments, interpreting their results, mitigating the effects and assessing the validity of a treatment often pose a challenge to model developers and model validators.

Additional complexities arise in case of the estimation of LGD parameters, rating systems covering [low-default portfolios]({{< ref "/courses/low_default_portfolios" >}}), acquisitions or divestments, changes to [definition of default]({{< ref "/courses/dod" >}})

## Learning Goals

After completing the course, the participants will be able to 

 * Understand and explain the conceptual basis for the guidelines regarding representativeness
 * Challenge and verify the completeness, correctness and compliance of representativeness assessments and mitigation
 * Set up a process and recognize key decisions for the identification of non-representativeness and quantification of its effects
 * Understand trade-offs between different approaches in terms of complexity, explainability, and conservatism 


## Target Audience

The course module is intended for:

 * IRB model developers
 * Model validators, Auditors and team leads with similar interests.
 * Supervisors and policy advisors wishing to gain insight in the challenges of regulation with regard to representativeness.
 * Model users, model risk management officers and Credit Risk Controllers wishing to enhance their understanding of representativeness


### Prerequisites
The material will be taught in English. 
Participants are advised to come equipped with a basic understanding of: 

 * the calculation of minimum capital requirements
 * modelling the PD, LGD and EAD/CCF risk parameters.

## Schedule

The module will be taught over{{< param nr_sessions >}} sessions of each {{< param session >}}. The track schedule will be planned in coordination with the client based on the selection of modules.

## Format

The material will be taught through active learning and spaced repetition with a focus on acquiring problem-solving strategies for relevant and realistic case studies.



#### Example case studies

For this module, examples of case studies are 

 * Identify major potential sources of uncertainty, given documentation of a PD estimation methodology
 * Compare the strengths and weaknesses of alternative MoC estimation approaches related to representativeness
 * Explain the relation between model risk and MoC to front office risk management
