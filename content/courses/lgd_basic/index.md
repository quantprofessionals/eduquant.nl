## Content

Loss Given Default (LGD) is one of the key risk parameters in the calculation of regulatory capital requirements. In the European Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR) LGD is defined as the ratio of the loss on an exposure due to the default of a counterparty to the amount outstanding at default. 

This introductory course provides an overview of regulatory requirements with regard to the estimation of the LGD risk parameters for performing and in-default exposures and treats the main challenges for developing and validating LGD models.

The participants will learn to think critically about the customary building blocks of LGD estimation: identifying data requirements, selecting risk drivers, building LGD models, realised LGD calculation, the treatment of incomplete cases, (downturn) LGD quantification, as well as model performance testing. 


## Learning Goals

After completing the course, the participants will

 * understand each of the main building blocks of LGD model development
 * identify important regulatory requirements and critical decisions taken during LGD model development
 * be familiar with common approaches to build LGD models for performing and defaulted exposures, and spot common pitfalls
 * learn the key considerations and approaches to calculate economic loss amounts, realised LGD and long-run average LGD values
 * gain a basic understanding of Downturn LGD quantification and Margin of Conservatism for LGD
 * understand backtesting approaches for LGD models and related regulatory requirements


## Target Audience

The course module is intended for:

 * IRB model developers and team leads with a specific interest in advanced LGD modelling topics.
 * Model validators and team leads with similar interests.
 * Supervisors and policy advisors wishing to gain insight in the challenges of applying regulation with regard to the LGD risk parameter.
 * Credit risk managers wishing to enhance their understanding of the LGD risk parameter.


### Prerequisites
The material will be taught in English. 
Participants are advised to come equipped with a basic understanding of:

 * the calculation of capital requirements
 * relevant regulation for A-IRB
 * modelling the LGD, PD and EAD/CCF risk parameters.


## Schedule

The module will be taught over{{< param nr_sessions >}} sessions of each {{< param session >}}. The track schedule will be planned in coordination with the client based on the selection of modules.



#### Example case studies

For this module, examples of case studies are 

 * Identify dependencies of each step in LGD estimation on important methodological considerations, such as the method of deriving the maximum period of recovery or the choice of recovery cash flow proxy
 * Give a comprehensive list of potential deficiencies of an LGD estimation based on shared documentation
 * Identify the major policy decisions underlying a compliant in-default LGD estimation
 * Define an approach for a treatment of potential biases due to representativeness issues, given documentation and data on portfolio characteristics and the opportunity of a Q&A session with a business representative
