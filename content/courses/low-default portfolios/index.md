## Content

Applying internal ratings based approaches for low-default portfolios comes with a specific set of additional challenges, because of the nature of the obligors, type of lending activities, complexity of recovery processes and credit risk cyclicality. 

Typical challenges, which will be discussed during the course, are

 * estimating PDs, cyclicality adjustments and MoC values where the number and rate of defaults is low or zero 
 * dealing with material sources of uncertainty and the estimation of a margin of conservatism
 * demonstrating compliance where both in the rating assignment process and model design and estimation there is a dominating reliance on expert judgement
 * identification of an economic downturn for globally distributed portfolios or exposures across industry sectors

The term *low-default portfolio* typically denotes credit exposures to large corporates, financial institutions and sovereigns, but these issues can be relevant for other types of exposures as well, for example

 * specialized lending and project finance
 * low-risk niche lending activities
 * smaller portfolios 

The exact course contents are adapted based on a survey under participants 4-6 weeks before start of the course.

## Learning Goals
<!-- learning goals should describe problem solving strategies -->
After completing the course, participants will

  * be familiar with typical approaches for dealing with the specific challenges in modelling and validating minimum capital requirements for **low-default portfolio** rating systems
  * know how to find, understand and substantiate compliance with the specific **regulatory requirements** relevant for these rating systems, in particular for expert-based models, shadow rating models and models covering global portfolios
  * be able to identify and challenge **key decisions** in the IRB modelling process for these portfolios
  * understand the **view of the regulator and supervisory expectations**
  * have a broad view of the impact of **new regulation** and Basel IV on these portfolios
  * grasp the concepts of and requirements for **specific modelling techniques** (for example, use of external data, Bayesian inference,  Pluto-Tasche) and know how to apply and challenge these 

## Target Audience

The course is intended for 

* IRB model developers and team leads with a specific interest in low-default portfolio IRB models
* Model validators and team leads with similar interests
* Supervisors and policy advisors wishing to gain insight in the challenges of applying regulation for LDP
* Credit risk managers wishing to enhance their understanding of IRB modelling for LDP

### Prerequisites

Participants are advised to come equipped with a broad understanding of credit risk modelling and IRB regulation.

## Format

The material will be taught through active learning and spaced repetition with a focus on acquiring problem-solving strategies for relevant and realistic case studies.


### Active learning

Extensive research [^1]<sup>, </sup>[^2]<sup>, </sup>[^3]<sup>, </sup>[^4]<sup>, </sup>[^5]<sup>, </sup>[^6] has shown that active, problem-driven learning strategies stimulate active engagement and are more effective than passive strategies. At eduquant, course participants actively participate in solving problems and working out mini-projects right from the start, after the first 10 minutes of introduction. Background material and theory is presented only afterwards, as part of the discussion and treatment of the solutions and outcomes of the problems. This ensures that students have an active interest in, and an immediate context for, the theoretical material being presented.  

### Spaced repetition

Another core element of the eduquant teaching strategy is the use of spaced sessions with retrieval practice, which has been shown [^7]<sup>, </sup>[^8] to consistently benefit long-term retention. The material is treated over the course of several sessions, rather than in a consecutive full-day schedule. After the first session, participants will be challenged to retrieve material treated in earlier sessions. 


### Case studies

At eduquant we believe specialist professionals are best helped by acquiring problem solving strategies for problems they are likely to encounter in their professional practice, rather than theoretical knowledge. Based on [our extensive experience]({{< ref "/#about" >}} "About us") as risk modellers, consultants, supervisors and researchers, we develop case studies that are highly relevant, realistic and close to the type of problems participants are likely to encounter in their profession, at any level of mastery. The outcome of the cases studies are discussed in a plenary session with additional context and theoretical background.

#### Example case studies

For this course, examples of case studies are 

 * Present arguments whether or not a proposed treatment of PD calibration for low-default portfolios is compliant with regulation
 * Give a comprehensive list of potential deficiencies of a downturn LGD derivation based on shared documentation
 * Identify the major policy decisions underlying a compliant EAD estimation for a low-default specialized lending portfolio
 * Compare and understand the impact of different treatments of LGD estimation based on prepared code samples and realistic data sets

### Online and offline

This course can be organised in an offline, an online, or a combined on- and offline version. 

#### Offline

Offline sessions can be offered on-premise as well as organized off site (priced at cost) - [contact us]({{< ref "/#contact" >}} "Contact Us") to discuss options. For all but the smallest groups (7 or more), we recommend to have the option to break out in separate groups of up to 4 participants. Offline sessions will be webcast, the main presentations recorded and shared for a limited time with participants for later review.

#### Online

For online participation we leverage the [ikuvikyu](https://ikyvikyo.org) <sub><sup>Ⓡ</sup></sub> platform which offers, besides the usual features for webconferencing, the options to 

 * opening breakout sessions for participants (for collaborative case studies)
 * multiway sharing and presenting (for sharing and presenting case study results)
 * interactive polling and surveys (for focused problem sets)
 
These features allow the trainers to engage with participants collectively as well as in smaller groups, or individually, for case studies. The main presentations will be recorded and shared for a limited time with participants for later review.


## Date and duration

The course is comprised of three morning or afternoon sessions of 4 hours each, once per week. Please [Contact us]({{< ref "/#contact" >}} "Contact Us") for details and options for the schedule.


## Pricing

Pricing is based on the level and duration of the course, and the number of participants per application. [See here]({{< ref "/pricing" >}} "Pricing") for additional information.
