## Content

Applying internal ratings based approaches for low-default portfolios comes with a specific set of additional challenges, because of the nature of the obligors, type of lending activities, complexity of recovery processes and credit risk cyclicality. 

Typical challenges, which will be discussed during the course, are

 * estimating PDs, cyclicality adjustments and MoC values where the number and rate of defaults is low or zero 
 * dealing with material sources of uncertainty and the estimation of a margin of conservatism
 * demonstrating compliance where both in the rating assignment process and model design and estimation there is a dominating reliance on expert judgement
 * identification of an economic downturn for globally distributed portfolios or exposures across industry sectors

The term *low-default portfolio* typically denotes credit exposures to large corporates, financial institutions and sovereigns, but these issues can be relevant for other types of exposures as well, for example

 * specialized lending and project finance
 * low-risk niche lending activities
 * smaller portfolios 

The exact course contents are adapted based on a survey under participants 4-6 weeks before start of the course.

## Learning Goals

After completing the course, participants will

  * be familiar with the specific challenges in modelling and validating minimum capital requirements for **low-default portfolio** rating systems
  * know the specific **regulatory requirements** relevant for these rating systems, in particular for expert-based models, shadow rating models and models covering global portfolios
  * be able to identify and challenge **key decisions** in the IRB modelling process for these portfolios
  * understand the **view of the regulator and supervisory expectations**
  * have a broad view of the impact of **new regulation** and Basel IV on these portfolios
  * grasp the concepts of and requirements for **specific modelling techniques** (for example, use of external data, Bayesian inference,  Pluto-Tasche) and know how to apply and challenge these 

## Target Audience

The course is intended for 

* IRB model developers and team leads with a specific interest in low-default portfolio IRB models
* Model validators and team leads with similar interests
* Supervisors and policy advisors wishing to gain insight in the challenges of applying regulation for LDP
* Credit risk managers wishing to enhance their understanding of IRB modelling for LDP

## Prerequisites

Participants are advised to come equipped with a broad understanding of credit risk modelling and IRB regulation.

## Format

The course will be taught through a combination of 

 * challenging case studies and interactive workshops
 * lectures (online and offline)
 * ongoing, interactive quizzes
 
## Date and duration

This course will take place over the course of 3 days in February, 2021.
