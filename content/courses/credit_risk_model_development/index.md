## Content

In 2004 the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision finalized a new framework for capital adequacy regulation based on three pillars. This framework was further revised in 2013 as is now known as “Basel III”, and formed the basis for the capital adequacy legislation of the European Union, called “The Capital Requirement Directive IV” or “CRD IV” which was implemented in January 2014 . This Directive is mandatory for all European banks and investment firms. Banks are required to hold sufficient capital to protect them against Unexpected Loss. In the Basel III framework, the amount of capital that a specific bank should hold is calculated on the basis of risk-weighted exposure amount (RWA) formulas. The RWA depends on several risk parameters which can be estimated through internal models under the IRB approach: Probability of Default (PD), Loss Given Default (LGD) and Exposure at Default (EAD) and -- in some cases -- Effective Maturity.

This course covers all material topics in the end-to-end model development process: from clarifying model requirements, to submitting to model validation/regulators; from the basic to more advanced modeling approaches; testing and validation of risk parameter models (PD, LGD and EAD).

## Learning Goals

After this course, you will be able to

 * Know how to read the relevant regulation for credit risk models
 * Develop probability of default (PD), loss given default (LGD), and exposure at default (EAD) models
 * Appropriate quantify a margin of conservatism
 * Effectively interact with model validation, internal audit and supervisors
 * Keep an audit trail during the modelling process
 * Validate, backtest, and benchmark credit risk models

## Target Audience

The course is intended for 

* IRB model developers with little or no prior experience in the field
* Specialist supervisors wishing to gain insight in internal model developer

### Prerequisites


Participants are advised to come equipped with basic understanding of:

 * (Credit) risk management
 * Statistics and probability theory

Some experience in programming with `python` or a similar statistical computing language is recommended for the case studies. 


## Schedule

The course will be taught over 8 sessions of each 4 hours, with at most 2 sessions per week. The final session schedule will be planned in coordination with participants prior to the start of the course.


#### Example case studies

For this course, examples of case studies are 

 * Present and challenge arguments whether or not a proposed treatment of PD calibration is compliant with regulation
 * Work out an outline of a minimum viable approach for estimating in-default LGD parameters
 * Compare and understand different treatments of PD calibration based on prepared code samples and realistic data sets
