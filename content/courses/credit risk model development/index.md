## Content

In 2004 the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision finalized a new framework for capital adequacy regulation based on three pillars. This framework was further revised in 2013 as is now known as “Basel III”, and formed the basis for the capital adequacy legislation of the European Union, called “The Capital Requirement Directive IV” or “CRD IV” which was implemented in January 2014 . This Directive is mandatory for all European banks and investment firms. Banks are required to hold sufficient capital to protect them against Unexpected Loss. In the Basel III framework, the amount of capital that a specific bank should hold is calculated on the basis of risk-weighted exposure amount (RWA) formulas. The RWA depends on several risk parameters which can be estimated through internal models under the IRB approach: Probability of Default (PD), Loss Given Default (LGD) and Exposure at Default (EAD) and -- in some cases -- Effective Maturity.

This course covers all material topics in the end-to-end model development process: from clarifying model requirements, to submitting to model validation/regulators; from the basic to more advanced modeling approaches; testing and validation of risk parameter models (PD, LGD and EAD).

## Learning Goals

After this course, you will be able to

 * Know how to read the relevant regulation for credit risk models
 * Develop probability of default (PD), loss given default (LGD), and exposure at default (EAD) models
 * Appropriate quantify a margin of conservatism
 * Effectively interact with model validation, internal audit and supervisors
 * Keep an audit trail during the modelling process
 * Validate, backtest, and benchmark credit risk models

## Target Audience

The course is intended for 

* IRB model developers with little or no prior experience in the field
* Specialist supervisors wishing to gain insight in internal model developer

### Prerequisites


Participants are advised to come equipped with basic understanding of:

 * (Credit) risk management
 * Statistics and probability theory

Some experience in programming with `python` or a similar statistical computing language is recommended for the case studies. 


## Format

The material will be taught through *active learning* and *spaced repetition* with a focus on acquiring *problem-solving strategies* for *relevant* and *realistic* case studies.


### Active learning

Extensive research [^1]<sup>, </sup>[^2]<sup>, </sup>[^3]<sup>, </sup>[^4]<sup>, </sup>[^5]<sup>, </sup>[^6] has shown that active, problem-driven learning strategies stimulate active engagement and are more effective than passive strategies. At eduquant, course participants actively participate in solving problems and working out mini-projects right from the start, after the first 10 minutes of introduction. Background material and theory is presented only afterwards, as part of the discussion and treatment of the solutions and outcomes of the problems. This ensures that students have an active interest in, and an immediate context for, the theoretical material being presented.  

### Spaced repetition

Another core element of the eduquant teaching strategy is the use of spaced sessions with retrieval practice, which has been shown [^7]<sup>, </sup>[^8] to consistently benefit long-term retention. The material is treated over the course of several sessions, rather than in a consecutive full-day schedule. After the first session, participants will be challenged to retrieve material treated in earlier sessions. 


### Realistic case studies

At eduquant we believe specialist professionals are best helped by acquiring problem solving strategies for problems they are likely to encounter in their professional practice, rather than theoretical knowledge. Based on [our extensive experience]({{< ref "/#about" >}} "About us") as risk modellers, consultants, supervisors and researchers, we develop case studies that are highly relevant, close to the type of problems participants are likely to encounter in their profession, at any level of mastery. The outcome of the cases studies are discussed in a plenary session with additional context and theoretical background.

#### Example case studies
<!- * this subsection is course-specific -->
For this course, examples of case studies are 

 * Present and challenge arguments whether or not a proposed treatment of PD calibration is compliant with regulation
 * Work out an outline of a minimum viable approach for estimating in-default LGD parameters
 * Compare and understand different treatments of PD calibration based on prepared code samples and realistic data sets

### Online and offline

This course can be organized in an offline, an online, or a combined on * and offline version. 

#### Offline

Offline sessions can be offered on-premise as well as organized off site (priced at cost). [Contact us]({{< ref "/#contact" >}} "Contact Us") to discuss options. For larger groups (7 or more), we recommend to have the option to break out in separate groups of up to 4 participants. Offline sessions will be webcast, the main presentations recorded and shared for a limited time with participants for later review.

#### Online

For online participation we leverage the [ikuvikyu](https://ikyvikyo.org)Ⓡ platform which offers, besides the usual features for webconferencing, the options to 

 * opening breakout sessions for participants (for collaborative case studies)
 * multiway sharing and presenting (for sharing and presenting case study results)
 * interactive polling and surveys (for focused problem sets)
 
These features allow the trainers to engage with participants collectively as well as in smaller groups, or individually, for case studies. The main presentations will be recorded and shared for a limited time with participants for later review.


## Date and duration

The course is comprised of eight morning or afternoon sessions of 4 hours each, twice per week. Please [Contact us]({{< ref "/#contact" >}} "Contact Us") for details and options for the schedule.
