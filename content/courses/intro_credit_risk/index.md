## Content

In 2004 the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision finalized a new framework for capital adequacy regulation based on three pillars. This framework was further revised in 2013 as is now known as “Basel III”, and formed the basis for the capital adequacy legislation of the European Union, called “The Capital Requirement Directive IV” or “CRD IV” which was implemented in January 2014\. 

This Directive is mandatory for all European banks and investment firms. Banks are required to hold sufficient capital to protect them against Unexpected Loss. In the Basel III framework, the amount of capital that a specific bank should hold is calculated on the basis of risk-weighted exposure amount (RWA) formulas. The RWA depends on several risk parameters which can be estimated through internal models under the IRB approach: Probability of Default (PD), Loss Given Default (LGD) and Exposure at Default (EAD) and -- in some cases -- Effective Maturity.
