## Content

Banks that decide and get approval to use internal models need to invest in developing and maintaining high quality models. They need to have sound internal validation and oversight processes in place.

As part of the general review phase of the Targeted Review of Internal Models (TRIM), the ECB has seen to emphasize and strengthen the role of the internal model validation function. The validation of internal models is a key component of Model Risk Management.

The Model Validation function presents a number of specific challenges:

 * how to maintain independence from model development functions and the Credit Risk Control Unit?
 * ...while at the same time ensuring that weaknesses are addressed effectively?
 * how to identify material versus less material regulatory compliance issues on technical subjects?
 * how to address structural weaknesses in the internal model development process and model governance framework?
 * how to motivate and retain senior experts?
 * what are common pitfalls in the relation between credit risk control unit, model validation and audit?
