## Summary

Model validation, the independent and effective challenge of risk model development, is a cornerstone of model risk control at larger and more mature financial institutions. The model validator must learn to question the credit risk model parameters, audit the decision making process and understand the trade-offs of the resulting model design choices. They need to understand the broader context of their inquiries and translate these into a sound advice to executive management. In addition, they need to understand regulation and internal policies, and the expectations of supervisors.
In this course, students learn how to validate credit risk models in the context of Basel III, the CRR with underlying regulatory technical standards and guidelines, as well as supervisory expectations. In this course, participants will study statistical foundations of model validation in combination with practical guidance for applying these, as well as more technical aspects of verifying the correctness and reproducibility results. The knowledge will be applied in several real-life case studies and exercises.

The exact course contents are adapted based on a survey under participants 4-6 weeks before start of the course.

## Learning Goals

After completing the course, participants will

 * be able to find, understand and interpret regulatory requirements for banks using internal models, and translate these into specific assessments   
 * know and reflect on the role and responsibilities of the model validation function within the bank
 * learn to question decision making processes and verify the reproducibility and correctness of results
 * understand and use procedures for statistical testing, benchmarking and the use of challenger models  
 * learn to use specific statistical tests to challenge key decisions in modelling probability of default (PD), loss given default (LGD), and exposure at default (EAD) models

## Target Audience

The course is intended for 

* IRB model validators with little or no prior experience in the field
* Specialist supervisors wishing to gain insight in internal model validation

## Prerequisites

Prior basic knowledge of statistical testing and modeling is strongly advised. Some experience in programming with `python` or a statistcal computing language may be helpful for the case studies, but is not required.

## Format

The course will be taught through a combination of 

 * lectures (online and offline)
 * ongoing, interactive quizzes 
 * break-out sessions with challenging case studies and hands-on workshops
 
## Date and duration

This course will take place over the course of 3 days in February, 2021.
