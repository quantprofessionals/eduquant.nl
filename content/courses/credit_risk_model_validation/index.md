## Content

Model validation, the independent and effective challenge of risk model development, is a cornerstone of model risk control at larger and more mature financial institutions.

The model validator must learn to question the credit risk model parameters, audit the decision making process and understand the trade-offs of the resulting model design choices. They need to understand the broader context of their inquiries and translate these into a sound advice to executive management. In addition, they need to understand regulation and internal policies, and the expectations of supervisors.

In this module, participants learn how to validate credit risk models in the context of the CRR and underlying regulatory technical standards and guidelines, as well as supervisory expectations. Statistical foundations of model validation will be explained in combination with practical guidance for applying these. Attention will also be given to validating documentation and more technical aspects of verifying the correctness and reproducibility results. 

During the course, participants work through real-life case studies and exercises, with an emphasis on the validation process, effective challenge and common pitfalls in model validation.


## Learning Goals

After completing the course, participants will

 * be able to find, understand and interpret regulatory requirements for banks using internal models, and translate these into specific assessments
 * know and reflect on the role and responsibilities of the model validation function within the bank
 * learn to question decision making processes and verify the reproducibility and correctness of results
 * understand and use procedures for statistical testing, benchmarking and the use of challenger models  
 * learn to use specific statistical tests to challenge key decisions in modelling probability of default (PD), loss given default (LGD), and exposure at default (EAD) models

## Target Audience

The course module is intended for 

* IRB model validators with little or no prior experience in the field
* Specialist supervisors wishing to gain insight in internal model validation

### Prerequisites

The material will be taught in English. 
Prior basic knowledge of statistical testing and modeling is strongly advised. Some experience in programming with `python` or a statistical computing language may be helpful for the case studies, but is not required.


## Schedule

The module will be taught over{{< param nr_sessions >}} sessions of each {{< param session >}}. The track schedule will be planned in coordination with the client based on the selection of modules.


#### Example case studies

For this module, examples of case studies are 

 * Present arguments whether or not a proposed treatment of PD calibration for low-default portfolios is compliant with regulation
 * Give a comprehensive list of potential deficiencies of a downturn LGD derivation based on shared documentation
 * Identify the major policy decisions underlying a compliant EAD estimation for a retail portfolio
 * Compare and understand the impact of different treatments of LGD estimation based on prepared code samples and realistic data sets
