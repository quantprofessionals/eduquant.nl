## Content

Risk quants approach regulatory modelling differently than supervisors do. A common source of  

Model validation, the independent and effective challenge of risk model development, is a cornerstone of model risk control at larger and more mature financial institutions.

The model validator must learn to question the credit risk model parameters, audit the decision making process and understand the trade-offs of the resulting model design choices. They need to understand the broader context of their inquiries and translate these into a sound advice to executive management. In addition, they need to understand regulation and internal policies, and the expectations of supervisors.

In this course, participants learn how to validate credit risk models in the context of the CRR and underlying regulatory technical standards and guidelines, as well as supervisory expectations. Statistical foundations of model validation will be explained in combination with practical guidance for applying these. Attention will also be given to validating documentation and more technical aspects of verifying the correctness and reproducibility results. The knowledge will be acquired through several real-life case studies and exercises.

The exact course contents are adapted based on a survey under participants 4-6 weeks before start of the course.

## Learning Goals

After completing the course, participants will

 * be able to find, understand and interpret regulatory requirements for banks using internal models, and translate these into specific assessments   
 * know and reflect on the role and responsibilities of the model validation function within the bank
 * learn to question decision making processes and verify the reproducibility and correctness of results
 * understand and use procedures for statistical testing, benchmarking and the use of challenger models  
 * learn to use specific statistical tests to challenge key decisions in modelling probability of default (PD), loss given default (LGD), and exposure at default (EAD) models

## Target Audience

The course is intended for 

* IRB model validators with little or no prior experience in the field
* Specialist supervisors wishing to gain insight in internal model validation

### Prerequisites

Prior basic knowledge of statistical testing and modeling is strongly advised. Some experience in programming with `python` or a statistical computing language may be helpful for the case studies, but is not required.


## Schedule

The course will be taught over 8 sessions of each 4 hours, with at most 2 sessions per week. The final session schedule will be planned in coordination with participants 6 weeks prior, and confirmed at the latest 4 weeks prior to the start of the course.

## Format

The material will be taught through active learning and spaced repetition with a focus on acquiring problem-solving strategies for relevant and realistic case studies.


### Active learning

Extensive research [^1]<sup>, </sup>[^2]<sup>, </sup>[^3]<sup>, </sup>[^4]<sup>, </sup>[^5]<sup>, </sup>[^6] has shown that active, problem-driven learning strategies stimulate active engagement and are more effective than passive strategies. At eduquant, course participants actively participate in solving problems and working out mini-projects right from the start, after the first 10 minutes of introduction. Background material and theory is presented only afterwards, as part of the discussion and treatment of the solutions and outcomes of the problems. This ensures that students have an active interest in, and an immediate context for, the theoretical material being presented.  

### Spaced repetition

Another core element of the eduquant teaching strategy is the use of spaced sessions with retrieval practice, which has been shown [^7]<sup>, </sup>[^8] to consistently benefit long-term retention. The material is treated over the course of several sessions, rather than in a consecutive full-day schedule. After the first session, participants will be challenged to retrieve material treated in earlier sessions. 


### Case studies

At eduquant we believe specialist professionals are best helped by acquiring problem solving strategies for problems they are likely to encounter in their professional practice, rather than theoretical knowledge. Based on [our extensive experience]({{< ref "/#about" >}} "About us") as risk modellers, consultants, supervisors and researchers, we develop case studies that are highly relevant, realistic and close to the type of problems participants are likely to encounter in their profession, at any level of mastery. The outcome of the cases studies are discussed in a plenary session with additional context and theoretical background.

#### Example case studies

For this course, examples of case studies are 

 * Present arguments whether or not a proposed treatment of PD calibration for low-default portfolios is compliant with regulation
 * Give a comprehensive list of potential deficiencies of a downturn LGD derivation based on shared documentation
 * Identify the major policy decisions underlying a compliant EAD estimation for a retail portfolio
 * Compare and understand the impact of different treatments of LGD estimation based on prepared code samples and realistic data sets

### Online and offline

This course can be organised in an offline, an online, or a combined on- and offline version. 

#### Offline

Offline sessions can be offered on-premise as well as organized off site (priced at cost) - [contact us]({{< ref "/#contact" >}} "Contact Us") to discuss options. For all but the smallest groups (7 or more), we recommend to have the option to break out in separate groups of up to 4 participants. Offline sessions will be webcast, the main presentations recorded and shared for a limited time with participants for later review.

#### Online

For online participation we leverage the [ikuvikyu](https://ikyvikyo.org)<sub><sup>Ⓡ</sup></sub>  platform which offers, besides the usual features for webconferencing, the options to 

 * opening breakout sessions for participants (for collaborative case studies)
 * multiway sharing and presenting (for sharing and presenting case study results)
 * interactive polling and surveys (for focused problem sets)
 
These features allow the trainers to engage with participants collectively as well as in smaller groups, or individually, for case studies. The main presentations will be recorded and shared for a limited time with participants for later review.


## Date and duration

The course is comprised of eight morning or afternoon sessions of 4 hrs each, once per week. Please [Contact us]({{< ref "/#contact" >}} "Contact Us") for details and options for the schedule.


## Pricing

Pricing is based on the level and duration of the course, and the number of participants per application. [See here]({{< ref "/pricing" >}} "Pricing") for additional information.
