## Modular magic

To ensure that participants can focus on content that is important to them at the moment they participate in trainings, at eduquant we offer materials in **bite-size** modules rather than in monolithic courses. Course modules typically focus on a single topic and come with minimal prerequisites.

## To the top

In principle, modules can be combined at will (subject to availability). However, to aid participants and managers with selecting a set of modules, we provide **tracks** which combine sets of course modules. Tracks either target specific professional functions, specific levels of expertise, or a specific set of related topics.
