## Modular magic

To ensure that participants can focus on content that is important to them at the moment they participate in trainings, at eduquant we offer materials in *bite-size* modules. Course modules typically focus on a single subtopic and come with minimal prerequisites. 

## To the top

In principle, course modules can be combined at will (subject to availability). However, to aid participants and managers with selecting a set of modules, we provide [tracks]({{< ref "/#curriculum" >}}) which combine sets of course modules. Tracks either target specific professional functions, specific levels of expertise, or a specific set of related topics. 

## Long-term relationship

If you book [multiple course modules]({{< ref "pricing" >}}) with us, we will contact you to determine a track schedule and course progression. Module sessions will be scheduled to allow for [spaced repitition]({{< ref "teaching_format" >}}), and material from multiple modules will feature in extended case studies and study problems.
