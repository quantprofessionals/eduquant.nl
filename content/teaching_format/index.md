At eduquant, we strive to bring modern insights into education to professional specialist training, with teaching formats and methods that have been proven effective in diverse settings. 

## The problem

Training post-graduates in a professional setting is prone to all the pitfalls of traditional education at schools and universities, and more. Common fundamental problems with professional training are 

 - **insufficient context and motivation** to grasp new material
 - **poor retention** of taught material beyond the duration of the course
 - **superficial understanding of details** without a solid background

At eduquant, we try to do better. 

## Training strategies

Different materials and audiences call for different learning strategies. Beginning specialists benefit from simple examples and broad context, whereas seasoned experts can absorb complex materials and deep-dives. 

Nevertheless, in each situation, we have found that for effective learning to happen, students need to be provided with these three building blocks:

 - **The need to learn** - offer problems first and solutions second
 - **Time to retain** - train memory to absorb new materials
 - **Deep learning** - emphasize fundamental theory over factoids

## Active learning

Extensive research [^1]<sup>, </sup>[^2]<sup>, </sup>[^3]<sup>, </sup>[^4]<sup>, </sup>[^5]<sup>, </sup>[^6] has shown that active, problem-driven learning strategies stimulate active engagement and are more effective than passive strategies. At eduquant, course participants actively participate in solving problems and working out mini-projects right from the start, after the first 10 minutes of introduction. Background material and theory is presented only afterwards, as part of the discussion and treatment of the solutions and outcomes of the problems. This ensures that students have an active interest in, and an immediate context for, the theoretical material being presented.  

### Case studies

At eduquant we believe specialist professionals are best helped by acquiring problem solving strategies for problems they are likely to encounter in their professional practice, rather than by absorbing superficial theoretical knowledge alone. Based on [our extensive experience]({{< ref "/#about" >}} "About us") as risk modellers, consultants, supervisors and researchers, we develop case studies that are highly relevant, realistic and close to the type of problems participants are likely to encounter in their profession, at any level of mastery. The outcome of the cases studies are discussed in a plenary session with additional context and theoretical background. 

#### Examples

Each course description summarizes the type of case studies that can be expected during that course.

## Spaced repetition

Another core element of the eduquant teaching strategy is the use of spaced sessions with retrieval practice, which has been shown [^7]<sup>, </sup>[^8] to consistently benefit long-term retention. The material is treated over the course of several sessions, rather than in a consecutive full-day schedule. After the first session, participants will be challenged to retrieve material treated in earlier sessions. 


## Fundamental theory

Risk quants and other specialist professionals rely on the integration of knowledge and skills over many topics. While an in-depth understanding of each related item is not usually feasible, without a solid understanding of the basic building blocks of new knowledge and skills, students often fail to integrate the new facts and tools into their existing corpus. 

Therefore, at eduquant, we strive to always provide insights into the underlying theoretical frameworks along with practical facts and tools.

## Online and offline

Courses can be organised in an offline, an online, or a combined on- and offline version. 

#### Offline

Offline sessions can be offered on-premise as well as organized off site (priced at cost) - [contact us]({{< ref "#contact" >}} "Contact Us") to discuss options. For groups of over 6 partipants, we recommend to have the option to break out in separate groups of up to 4 participants. Offline sessions will be webcast, the main presentations recorded and shared for a limited time with participants for later review.

#### Online

For online participation, presentation videos and slides are multicast to participants. In addition, the sessions allow

 * opening breakout sessions for participants (for collaborative case studies)
 * multiway sharing and presenting (for sharing and presenting case study results)
 * interactive polling and surveys (for focused problem sets)
 
These features allow the trainers to engage with participants collectively as well as in smaller groups, or individually, for case studies. The main presentations will be recorded and shared for a limited time with participants for later review.
